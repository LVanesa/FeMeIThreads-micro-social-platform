# FeMeIThreads - Student Social Network - ASP.NET Core MVC 

## Overview
**FeMeIThreads** is a social networking application inspired by Threads, specifically designed for students of our university. It allows users to connect with each other, create and manage profiles, join groups, post messages, and interact with other users through comments and messaging. The application supports three types of users: unregistered visitors, registered users, and administrators.

## Features
- **User Types**: The application supports three types of users: unregistered visitors, registered users, and administrators.
- **Profile Search**: Users can search for other users' profiles using either their full name or partial name components. Profiles can be found even if users search for specific parts of the name. However, profiles are only visible if they are *public*.
- **Profile Editing**: Registered users can create and edit their profiles.
- **Profile Visibility**: Users can set the visibility of their profile to either public or private when editing their profile.
- **Group Joining**: Users can join groups of people if they have an active account on the platform.
- **Media Posts and Comments**: Users can post text, images, and embedded videos from other platforms. They can also discuss posts through comments. Users can edit and delete their own comments and posts, but they cannot edit or delete comments made by other users.
- **Group Messaging**: Users belonging to a group can send messages to the group and edit or delete their own group messages.
- **Follow Requests**: Users can send or receive follow requests. However, users can only view the profile of the other user if the request is accepted. Follow requests are sent only when the profile is private. If the profile is public, any user can view the information in that profile.
- **Administrative Control**: Administrators are responsible for ensuring the proper functioning of the platform. They have the authority to delete any content (comments, messages, users, etc.) deemed inappropriate.
